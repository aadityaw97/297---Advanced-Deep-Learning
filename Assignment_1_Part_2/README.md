## Instruction

###Part 2 :

Semi supervised learnign assignment

a) Pick an appropriate problem domain for semi supervised  learning for which a small data set is readily available, Implement and submit a proper colab with proper ablation study (with various tunings) using tensorboard  for semi supervised  learning. Submit a nice readme explaining the problem you are trying to solve with multi instance learning, the approach. Make sure the colab is highly commented and readable with proper results confusion matrices, metrics, showing error examples the model not able to identify etc.,. - follow the template in https://github.com/fastai/fastbook (Links to an external site.) and https://github.com/fastai/fastbook/blob/master/04_mnist_basics.ipynb (Links to an external site.) and https://github.com/fastai/fastbook/blob/master/05_pet_breeds.ipynb (Links to an external site.) for the results. The results visualization is very important aspect of the overall problem.  Aim for state of art approach (extra points)  to solve this problem 

Note: pick reasonable training set and reasonable problem - not 100s of millions of instances.
